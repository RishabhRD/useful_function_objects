# Useful Function Objects

Inspired by Conor Hoekstra (@codereport), I am also trying to maintain a set of
useful function objects.

These function objects, appear many times in my day to day coding and I need to
write lambdas for that and that's so clumpsy to write.
So, why not have function objects for that.
